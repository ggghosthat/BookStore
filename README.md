## Technologies and Methodologies

Here's a breakdown of the technologies and methodologies used in this project:

1. **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 8):**
   - The foundation of our web application, providing a robust framework for building dynamic web pages.

2. **Entity Framework Core (EF Core):**
   - Used as an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool to interact with the database.
   - Enables seamless communication between the application and SQL Server.

3. **SQL Server:**
   - Our chosen database management system for storing book details and user data.

4. **Multi-tier Architecture:**
   - Organizes the application into logical layers (presentation, business logic, data access) for better maintainability and scalability.

5. **Repository Pattern:**
   - Provides a clean and consistent interface for data access.
   - Separates data access logic from business logic.

6. **Unit of Work Pattern:**
   - Manages transactions and context sharing across multiple database operations.

7. **Areas:**
   - Partitions the ASP.NET Core Web app into smaller functional groups (e.g., admin, customer).

8.  **Scaffolded Identity:**
    - Automatically generates code for user authentication and authorization features.

9. **Server-side Validation:**
    - Utilizes Tag Helpers and data annotations to validate user input.

10. **Client-side Validation:**
    - Implements jQuery validation for real-time feedback.

11. **View Models:**
    - Connects the Category and Product (Book) models for efficient data representation.

12. **Partial Views:**
    - Reusable components that enhance code modularity and maintainability.
 
14. **Bootstrap for Styling:**
    - Ensures a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

14. **TempData for Alert Management:**
    - Provides notifications and alerts to users during their interactions with the application.

15. **Toastr for Notifications:**
    - Enhances user experience with customizable notifications.
